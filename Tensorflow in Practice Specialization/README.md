Exercise notebooks of Dr. Andrew Ng's and Laurence Moroney's ML/DL course.
 
If the notebooks do not get displayed on the first try, press "releoad" as often times as needed until they show.
 
Notebooks were by standard presented in Google CoLab (Linux). I re-wrote many of them to run on my Windows machine to allow for faster model training.
